## Audacity
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
I used Audacity to create and/or manipulate the sound files to a format usable by the YX5200 audio chip.

## FreeSound
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
I obtained one file from FreeSound that I didn't create with Audacity.
- https://freesound.org

This sound was SFX_STICKERRIPPER_foilBooms_01.wav found at https://freesound.org/people/MrFossy/sounds/590360/. It was generated by a user named "MrFossy".
- I will refer to any sound file with a derivation from this sound by the name "Mr. Fossy".
- In the text relating to this file on FreeSound it says
```
Feel free to use my sounds for any commercial/noncommercial purpose without attribution.
 (I wouldn't object to being credited, however!)
```

Thank you MrFossy!

## YX5200 DFplayer
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
Using the YX5200 to read the sound files and drive the 8-ohm speaker.

This repo has a lot of info on making .wav files that are suitable for the YX5200. I use .wav instead of .mp3 both because it works better with more clones of the YX5200 and because there is a noticeable start-up delay with .mp3 files.

## Creating and Modifying Sound Files
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>

### Generate Chirp
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
Menu: **Generate** ==> **Chirp...** then use the settings shown.<br>

### After Generate Chirp
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
You can see the gradual crescendo.<br>

### Export Chirp
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
We save it as a 22050 Hz mono .wav file; see https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/AudioPlayer-YX5200 for the reason.<br>

### Generate Silence
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
Menu: **Generate** ==> **Silence...** then use the settings shown.<br>

### Import Mr. Fossy
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
Menu: **File** ==> **Import** ==> **Audio...** and choose the file.<br>

## Copy the Files to MicroSD Card
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
The MicroSD card **must** be freshly formatted as FAT32; see https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/AudioPlayer-YX5200

Also from that reference, use copyem.py to create a list of commands to copy the files in correct order onto the MicroSD card.
- I use GIT bash on Windows to do this; my script is run_copyem.sh which assumes
  - the freshly FAT32-formatted MicroSD card is mounted as H: (Windows)
  - I am running the script from the directory containing the .wav files
  - that same directory contains Attributions.html file that I want stored on the MicroSD card
  - I want the output as a bash script not a Windows .bat format
  - once again, I suggest you look at https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/AudioPlayer-YX5200 for more details

You could either just let the commands show up on the screen and copy/paste them back into the GIT bash screen, but run_copyem.sh redirects them to file copy_files.sh.

Here is what my script run_copyem.sh looks like:<br>
```
python /d/github-Mark-MDO47/AudioPlayer-YX5200/copyem.py -d . -s H: -f 0003_YX5200_Silence.wav -l > copy_files.sh
```

Here is what the output script copy_files.sh looks like:<br>
```
cp ./0001_yx5200_chirp.wav H:/001.wav
cp ./0002_yx5200_mrfossy__sfx_stickerripper_foilbooms_01.wav H:/002.wav
cp ./0003_yx5200_silence.wav H:/003.wav

mkdir H:/ATTRIBUTIONS
cp  ./Attributions.html H:/ATTRIBUTIONS
```
