## Audacity
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
I used Audacity to create and/or manipulate the sound files to a format usable by the YX5200 audio chip.

## FreeSound
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
I obtained one file from FreeSound that I didn't create with Audacity.
- https://freesound.org

This sound was SFX_STICKERRIPPER_foilBooms_01.wav found at https://freesound.org/people/MrFossy/sounds/590360/. It was generated by a user named "MrFossy".
- I will refer to any sound file with a derivation from this sound by the name "Mr. Fossy".
- In the text relating to this file on FreeSound it says
```
Feel free to use my sounds for any commercial/noncommercial purpose without attribution.
 (I wouldn't object to being credited, however!)
```

Thank you MrFossy!

## YX5200 DFplayer
[Top](#ring-the-bell-sounds "Top")<br>
Using the YX5200 to read the sound files and drive the 8-ohm speaker.

This repo has a lot of info on making .wav files that are suitable for the YX5200. I use .wav instead of .mp3 both because it works better with more clones of the YX5200 and because there is a noticeable start-up delay with .mp3 files.
